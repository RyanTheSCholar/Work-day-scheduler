# Work-day-scheduler

## Description

I wanted to build a project with jquery so that I could get a better understanding of the syntax and overall logic of JavaScript. I also engaged the concept of localStorage in this case saving items to the selected div id, also creating a dynamic function that changes the color of the text area when it is current, past or present which allowed me to get a better understanding of traversing and if statements. This project solves the problem of not having to set a new work day schedule upon page load every time due to the local storage implementation.
Some key points of learning for me this project are I need to focus more on functional coding instead trying to dive in on the most optimal code, because I am very new to this world grasping the core concepts and then going back and spicing up the code will be my next goal on upcoming challenges and projects.
